import Foundation

// The CarPlay HUD's display model. A CarPlay driving-task app cannot draw its own views, so the only
// pixels Cairn controls are the images inside list rows. Everything that decides *what* those rows and
// images say lives here, in plain values with no UIKit or CarPlay import, so it can be tested.
//
// Two ideas run through the whole file:
//
//  1. The row set never changes. Every row has a stable `HUDRowID`, and a snapshot always carries the
//     same ids in the same order. The CarPlay layer builds the rows once and then only rewrites their
//     text and images, so a BLE dropout never reloads or collapses the list.
//
//  2. Nothing is ever blanked. A reading the dongle has stopped sending keeps its last value and gains
//     an age, and its gauge fades through `Freshness`. "No data" and "data from 14 seconds ago" are
//     different claims, and the driver gets told which one they are looking at.
